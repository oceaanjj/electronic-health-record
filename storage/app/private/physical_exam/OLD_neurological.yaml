    - keywords: ['hemiparesis', 'hemiplegia', 'one-sided weakness']
      alert: 'Hemiparesis (one-sided weakness) is a hallmark of an upper motor neuron lesion, most commonly a stroke.'
      severity: 'critical'
    - keywords: ['facial droop', 'flattened nasolabial fold']
      alert: "Facial droop suggests a lesion of the facial nerve (CN VII). A central lesion (stroke) spares the forehead, while a peripheral lesion (Bell's Palsy) involves the entire side of the face."
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['dysarthria', 'slurred speech']
      alert: 'Dysarthria (difficulty forming words) can result from lesions of CN X or XII, or from cerebellar or central nervous system damage.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['ataxia', 'ataxic gait', 'incoordination']
      alert: 'Ataxia (impaired coordination) suggests a cerebellar disorder. Observe gait and perform point-to-point testing.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['resting tremor', 'pill-rolling tremor']
      alert: "A resting, pill-rolling tremor that disappears with movement is a classic sign of Parkinson's disease."
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['intention tremor']
      alert: 'An intention tremor (tremor that worsens with intentional movement) is a sign of a cerebellar disorder.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['positive Romberg test', 'loses balance with eyes closed']
      alert: 'A positive Romberg test (loss of balance when eyes are closed) indicates poor position sense (proprioception), often due to posterior column disease or peripheral neuropathy.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['pronator drift']
      alert: 'Pronator drift (downward drift and pronation of an outstretched arm) is a sensitive sign of a contralateral corticospinal tract lesion.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['glove and stocking neuropathy', 'distal sensory loss']
      alert: "A 'glove-and-stocking' pattern of sensory loss is characteristic of peripheral neuropathy, commonly seen in diabetes and alcoholism."
      severity: 'info'
    - keywords: ['hyperreflexia', 'clonus', '4+ reflexes']
      alert: 'Hyperreflexia and clonus are signs of an upper motor neuron lesion.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['absent reflexes', 'areflexia', '0 reflexes']
      alert: 'Absent deep tendon reflexes suggest a lower motor neuron lesion, such as a peripheral neuropathy or spinal nerve root compression.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['positive Babinski sign', 'upgoing toe', 'extensor plantar response']
      alert: 'A positive Babinski sign (dorsiflexion of the big toe) is a key indicator of a corticospinal (upper motor neuron) tract lesion.'
      severity: 'warning'
    - keywords: ['nuchal rigidity', 'stiff neck', 'meningismus']
      alert: 'Nuchal rigidity (stiff neck with resistance to flexion) is a critical sign of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage.'
      severity: 'critical'
