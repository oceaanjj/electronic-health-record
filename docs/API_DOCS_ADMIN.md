## 🚀 Quick Start Tutorial (Complete Guide)

This tutorial walks you through the common workflow of a System Administrator using the API.

### 1. Authenticate
Before any action, you must log in to obtain a Bearer Token.
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Body:** `{ "username": "admin_user", "password": "secure_password" }`
- **Action:** Save the `access_token` from the response. Include it in the header of all subsequent requests: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`.

### 2. Monitor System Health
Check the dashboard stats to see current user counts and system activity.
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/stats`
- **What to look for:** Ensure `total_users` matches your expectations and check `audit_logs_today` for recent activity.

### 3. Register a New Staff Member
When a new nurse or doctor joins, register their account with complete personal details.
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "username": "nurse_jane",
    "email": "jane@hospital.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "nurse",
    "full_name": "Jane Doe",
    "birthdate": "1992-08-24",
    "age": 33,
    "sex": "Female",
    "address": "789 Medical Plaza, West City",
    "birthplace": "Central Hospital"
  }
  ```

### 4. Search and Update User Profiles
If a staff member changes their address or you need to update their role.
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/users?search=Jane` (Find the user ID)
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}`
- **Body:** `{ "address": "New Address 101", "role": "doctor" }`

### 5. Review the Audit Trail
Verify that the registration and updates were recorded correctly in the system logs.
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/audit-logs`
- **Verification:** Look for actions like `USER REGISTRATION` or `USER UPDATED`. The `sentence` field will provide a human-readable explanation of what occurred.
